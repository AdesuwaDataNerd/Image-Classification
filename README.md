# Image Classification with Neural Network

This project focuses on image classification using a neural network. Leveraging the power of deep learning, the neural network is designed to analyze and categorize images into predefined classes. The project aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in handling image classification tasks.

## Key Features
- Utilizes a neural network architecture for image classification.
- Trains on labeled image datasets to learn patterns and features.
- Provides a foundation for understanding and implementing deep learning in image recognition.

## Introduction

Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning predefined labels to images based on their content. Deep learning, particularly neural networks, has shown remarkable performance in image classification tasks. This project employs a neural network to learn and recognize patterns in images, enabling accurate categorization into specific classes.

### Why Neural Network?

Neural networks, with their ability to automatically learn hierarchical features, are well-suited for image classification tasks. The use of convolutional layers allows the network to capture spatial hierarchies and extract relevant features from images, making them highly effective in discerning intricate patterns.

### Goals

- Implement a neural network for image classification.
- Train the model on labeled image datasets to learn distinctive features.
- Evaluate the model's performance on new, unseen images.
- Showcase the potential of deep learning in image recognition.
